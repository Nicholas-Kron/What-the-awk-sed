**What the `awk` `sed`**
===================
_an introduction to_ `sed` _and_ `awk` _for biologists_
----------------------------------------------------------

This is a cursory introduction to the UNIX utilities `sed` and `awk` that are incredibly useful tools for your day to day data management and cleaning in computational biology. The intent of this introduction is to highlight some practical uses of `sed` and `awk` for common computational biology file types and low level problems.

I assume you have had a basic introduction to UNIX and the Bourne Again Shell (bash) and can navigate between directories, read and write files, and, ideally, use `grep` is. If you have used `sed` or `awk` before, this introduction is likely not for you. If you have no idea what any of that meant, this is also not for you. If, however, you are a newbie UNIX user that wants to expand their toolkit and take their computational biology to the next level, you've come to the right place!
